<h2>Revolutionizing Text-to-Speech </h2>

TeleSpeech is an AI Chrome Extension that converts Telegram messages into speech, mimicking the distinct voice of each sender. Using the chrome extension and the web app, you can upload anyone's voice and use it to read messages out loud in a Telegram group chat. 

Our project is an attempt to improve the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-text-to-speech-onlin/npdkkcjlmhcnnaoobfdjndibfkkhhdfn">"Free Text To Speech Online"</a> chrome extension, which does text-to-speech with a default voice. We tried to improve the Chrome extension by allowing customizable voices and only having it read the content within a text message and not everything on a page. 

Usage:

1. Go to https://telespeakto.us
2. Sign up for an account, and upload audio files of voices you want to use for the text-to-speech. For each audio file, set the name as the username displayed on the Telegram chat
3. Download this repository as a zip, and upload the "ronanchromextension" directory to chrome://extensions/ (Make sure developer mode is On, and you upload it using "Load Unpacked"
4. Open the Telegram web app, sign into your account on the chrome extension, and press play for any group chat. The extension will then play each person's text out loud in that person's voice üëç
